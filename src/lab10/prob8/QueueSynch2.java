 * a well-known problem that is documented in Java's
 * Vector class. Typically it is expected that the
 * user of the class will properly lock blocks of code
 * that access adds and removes in succession. See
 * QueueSynch2 for a version that anticipates this problem
 * (and takes the responsibility out of the client's
 * hands)
