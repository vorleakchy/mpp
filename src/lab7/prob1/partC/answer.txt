Problem: Because there is missing hashCode() implements in Employee class.
	HashMap tracker, tracker.containsKey(e) will look up hashCode of each employee in the collection.
	Equal objects must produce the same hash code as long as they are equal.
	
Solution: We need to implement hashCode() in Employee class.
